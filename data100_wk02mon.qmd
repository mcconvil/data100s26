I will refer to ChatGPT but I generally mean the various generative AI tools.

### Generative AI Engagements

-   Went to looooots of talks on generative AI

-   Talked to ChatGPT, Gemini, and others

-   Attended a workshop on data analysis with AI

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  {#chatgpt data-menu-title="ChatGPT"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ChatGPT Strengths

-   Impressive but dangerous **automated** data analysis.
    -   Hard to determine if its conclusions are based on the data at hand or the data the large language model was built on.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### DATA 100 Goals

-   Learn that data analysis is a **humanistic** endeavor where context drives the data analysis process.
    -   Still need to be careful about biases and data quality.
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A **personalized** tutor (especially for coding) that tells you the answers.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   For you to **learn** to code and to **think** statistically.
    -   The DATA 100 Teaching Team will help support that learning.
:::

-   Instantly generating written blurbs.
:::

-   For you to learn how to communicate about your data work and data ethics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My View on the (Current) Role of ChatGPT in Data Work

-   To generate code to realize **fully conceived** ideas that aren't novel or advanced.

-   **Seasoned data scientist** can/should:

    -   Verify the correctness of the code.
    -   Identify any assumptions or defaults ChatGPT is employing.
    -   Run the code in `R` and draw conclusions based on the data to reduce risk of perpetuating biases that exist in ChatGPT's training data.

-   So, ChatGPT might be useful to you **near the end of** DATA 100 but will be detrimental to your learning **during most of** DATA 100.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Policy for DATA 100

We are going to take a two-pronged approach to AI in the course:

* (No AI) For the first 13 weeks of the course, you are not to use AI tools.  Therefore, we expect that all work students submit during this period will be their own. This includes code, written work, and oral assessments. During this period, we specifically forbid the use of ChatGPT or any other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools at all stages of the work process, including preliminary ones, unless the assignment specifically states that it is allowed.

* (AI) Near the end of the course, we will address the question of how AI can help in data work. At that point in the semester, you are free to experiment with various AI tools on assignments.  

In lecture and on individual assignments, we will make it clear which approach to AI students can take.  If it is unclear, make sure to ask.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Engagement

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br>

![](img/jessica-knowlden--AvRbJOVUKA-unsplash.jpg){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

-   Being **actively present** is key.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   During lecture and lab, remove distractions.
    -   When we are on our computers, close email, social media, news, etc.
    -   If you will be using a computer/tablet for taking notes, please sit in the second row **starting next lecture** so as not to distract classmates.
    -   Hide your phone.
-   I have high expectations but know that all of you (regardless of your stats or computing background) have the ability to meet them.

### Getting Help with `R`

![](img/rhelp001.jpg)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Novices asking the internet for `R` help = `r emo::ji("cold_sweat")`

-   **Get help from the DATA 100 teaching staff or classmates!**

    -   Will start p-sets in lab each week.
    -   Use the Slack `#q-and-a` channel.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Get help **early** before `r emo::ji("rage")` sets in!
    -   Be prepared for missing commas and quotes, capitalization issues, etc...
-   Later in the semester, will learn tricks for effectively getting `R` help online.
