Therefore, we expect that all work students submit during this period will be their own. This includes code, written work, and oral assessments. During this period, we specifically forbid the use of ChatGPT or any other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools at all stages of the work process, including preliminary ones, unless the assignment specifically states that it is allowed.\n(AI) Near the end of the course, we will address the question of how AI can help in data work. At that point in the semester, you are free to experiment with various AI tools on assignments.\n\nIn lecture and on individual assignments, we will make it clear which approach to AI students can take. If it is unclear, make sure to ask."
